AI is our target.
ML is one of the approach.
DL is one of the methods of ML.


## What is ML : 
Looking for a Function from data.
  - Speech recognition
  - Image recognition
  - Playing Go
  - Dialogue system


## Framework of ML
  - Prepare a function set (Model)
  - Goodness of function
  - Pick the best function

## Learning Map
  - Tasks
    - Regression : Find out a function. The output of the target function is a "scaler"(a number)
    - Classification: Output is Yes/No (Binary Classification) or multiple class (Multi-class Classification)

  - Supervised Learning
    - Linear model 
    - Non-linear model
      - Deep learning has hierarchical structure
      - SVM
      - Decision tree
      - K-NN
